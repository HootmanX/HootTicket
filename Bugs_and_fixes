# HootTicket

Encountered (potential) Issues:

1. password visible in code
2. creating new instance of class Ticket for each opened ticket. instead of just overwriting the same ticket.
3. Upon exiting the program - all data is lost.
4. menu.py line 66 - print("Ticket #" + str(a) + ":" + i.issue) [TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str]
5. storing data in a sqlite3 db, can add ticket enteries, must overcome appending comments
6. error checking - ex: comment ticket that ddoes not exist



Possible Solutions: * denotes fix was implemented

1. store user/pass in separate file being referenced (hash file for security)
* 2. Create a list, append each entry to the list using .append(CLASS(arg1, arg2)) - read up on stackoverflow *
3. store all data in file (csv perhaps?) or database to be referenced/overwritten
