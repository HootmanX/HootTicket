# HootTicket

Encountered (potential) Issues:

1. password visible in code
2. creating new instance of class Ticket for each opened ticket. instead of just overwriting the same ticket.
3. Upon exiting the program - all data is lost.
4. menu.py line 66 - print("Ticket #" + str(a) + ":" + i.issue) [TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str]
5. storing data in a sqlite3 db, can add ticket enteries, must overcome appending comments
6. error checking - ex: comment ticket that does not exist
7. lots of unnecessary code after implementing DB
8. comments not showing up when viewing (unless viewing all)
9. comments not printing after intial code added from number 8 above.



Possible Solutions: * denotes fix was implemented

1. store user/pass in separate file being referenced (hash file for security)
* 2. Create a list, append each entry to the list using .append(CLASS(arg1, arg2)) - read up on stackoverflow *
3. store all data in file (csv perhaps?) or database to be referenced/overwritten
4. python print str and int using a comma. EX: print("Text starts on line: ", storedIntVariable, "\n")
5. commenting - create new table reference ID using foreign key to store appending comments into a new table.
6. Add checking through IF statements. EX: select a ticket # - user inputs "a" - output: "incorrect selection, please type the number of the ticket"
   Sudo code:   if inputVariable != valueRange, print(errorMsg)
7. Re-do menu to call DB data instead of pulling from input data
   This way when program is closed and reopened it will use stored data
   code readability is significantly better
   less redundent code
8. addComment method was adding comments but not specifying to what ticket. Incorporated using foriegn key references ticket id.
9. the addComment order of arguments was swapped, once swapped to correct orientation all worked.
