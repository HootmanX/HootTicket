Ticketing system

Pend ticket

	- change state to closed
Comment ticket
	- add comment to list of comment
track time


UI

Potential log in for user / log out
display open tickets
	- view ticket comments
display closed tickets
	- ticket comments
submission - add comment / close ticket / open ticket

Future work
-incorporate a way to save data when program is not running, have not decided if I want to go with a simple text file to write to/parse/pull from, or delve into databases. 
-create a list of user login/passwords – need to set up way to hash or protect that data
-UI/UX development perhaps, web based using html/css perhaps, hosted through gitpages.
-User levels: users can submit and view / “techs” can update/comment/close


data persistence
- sqlite

Ticket needs an ID(int) and an Issue(str) and store all comments appended(list) and Time opened.
After incorporating SQLite3 I may not need openTicket file at all. All data parsing is handled now in HootDB.py.
